# Chat-Room

## General information

This program is a simple chat room implemented with Python-language. This is a school project that I did during a course "Computer Networks" in a group of two people. Me and my partner contributed equally much to this project.

## Requirements for using the program

This program has been tested with python version 3.5. Also PyQt5-library is needed for this program. This program has been tested only on Linux-environment.

## How to use the program

This project consists of two programs: a server-program and a client-program. The server-program can be started on the command line by writing "python3 Server.py". To start the client-program, the IP-address of the server must be known. The client-program can be started on the command line by writing "python3 Client.py "server-IP-address"" (for example "python3 Client.py 1.2.3.4). This program should work with both IPv4- and global IPv6-addresses.
